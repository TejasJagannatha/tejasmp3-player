Install all the necessary libraries by running the command 

-> pip install -r requirements.txt

Once done copy the URL of songs from youtube and paste it in the "songs.txt"
file one below the other. (you can paste it as many links one below the other).

Run the Script tejasmp3_player.py and the bunch of URl's will be converted into Audio formats.
